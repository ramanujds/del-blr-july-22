 Spring is an open source framework.
 Spring uses Dependency Injection and IOC

---------------------

The method to be called immediately after creation of bean is specified by attribute	

init-method

---------------------

Spring Container can be created by	
                 	ClassPathXmlApplicationContext  


---------------------

In Spring, the <bean> tag in xml configuration file is replaced by annotation	
                     	@Component


---------------------

For spring to use a class for configuration instead of xml, the class has to be annotated with	
      @Configuration         


---------------------

What is default scope of bean in Spring framework?	
            singleton  


---------------------

Annotation @Autowired can be applied on	
        Method	Constructor	Property




---------------------

Spring is	
    open source framework	

---------------------

Different types of bean injection are	
        constructor, setter


---------------------

Which are of spring module	
       AOP	ORM	MVC


---------------------

In spring controller is	 
       interface	


---------------------

Annotation @RequestMapping is used for	
     		Mapping URL to a method in controller

---------------------

application.properties is used for	
 Configuring the server port, database parameters and jpa properties	


---------------------

ApplicationContext extends	
    BeanFactory    


---------------------

Which  are annotations used with a class in hibernate?	
	@Entity	@Column @Table @Id @OneToOne


---------------------

Once hibernate creates a table for an Object we can add a property to the class for saving again	and hibernate adds another column to table


---------------------

To auto-inject into a field a bean by its name :
   By using both the @Autowired and the @Qualifier annotations
   By using the @Autowired annotation and naming the bean with the field name	


---------------------

For starting a Spring Boot application	
We have to annotate main class with @SpringBootApplication and execute SpringApplication.run	


---------------------

Annotations part of Spring Rest :
 @RestController
 @GetMapping
 @RequestBody
 @PathVariable
 @PostMapping


---------------------

For autogenerating the id of an entity by jpa hibernate we need to use annotation on id	
 @GeneratedValue	


---------------------

If Entity 'Manager' has a Set of 'Project', then the association of 'Manager' to 'Project' Set will be annotated with	
           @OneToMany


---------------------

Which are methods in JpaRepository?
deleteAll()
findAll()
count()
existsById(Integer id)


---------------------

For id to be autogenerated, JPA hibernate creates a sequence named	
        hibernate_sequence


---------------------

In spring, exception handler class should be annotated with	
   @RestControllerAdvice	



---------------------

Spring uses a servlet in SpringMVC named
   DispatcherServlet	


---------------------

To map the logical view into a physical resource like jsp, spring uses	InternalResourceViewResolver	





---------------------

To implement Swagger in Spring Boot application we need to:	

create class implementing interface WebMvcConfigurer with annotations @EnableSwagger2 and @Configuration	





---------------------

The methods in EntityManager are :
  persist
  merge
  find
  remove	




---------------------

IOC Container does the following things-

Find Beans
Identify their dependencies and wire the dependencies
Manage Life cycle of the bean(creation,processing and destruction)


---------------------

Scopes of a spring bean in a web application context :

   Singleton,Prototype,Request,session,Application 




---------------------

class A {
  private B b; 
  A(B b) {
    this.b=b;
   }
   public void setB(B b) {
    this.b = b;
   }
} 
Here type of Dependency injection you can use :
   Constructor Injection 
   Setter method based injection 



---------------------

Correct syntax for annotation wiring to bean configuration: 
 <context:annotation-config/> 


---------------------

Use of <ref> in Spring framework : 
 <ref> is used with bean id.
 <ref> can be used with constructor injection. 
 <ref> can be used with setter method injection





---------------------

 Different types of Autowire : 
 byName 
 byType 
 constructor 


---------------------

Sssential components of Spring Boot
   Spring Boot Starter


---------------------

@RestController annotation in Spring Boot is a combination of
     @ResponseBody and @Controller annotations to the class.


---------------------

ClassPathXmlApplicationContext searches .xml file : 
  anywhere in classpath (including jar file) 


---------------------

JPA implementation is provided by ORMs
  Hibernate
  Toplink
  EclipseLink
  Apache OpenJPA

---------------------

What is the Life Cycle of a Jpa Entity?
 New / Transient
 Managed / Persisted
 Detached


---------------------

JAX-RS is a JAVA based programming language API and specification to provide support for created RESTful Webservices.
